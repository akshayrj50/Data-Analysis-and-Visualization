# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.

## Learning
- How to visualize time series data with line plots.
- How to visualize correlations with scatter plots.
- How to visualize frequency distributions with bar plots and histograms.
- How to speed up our exploratory data visualization workflow with the pandas library.
- How to compare graphs using grid charts.

## Conclusion

This project set out to identify key indicators of heavy traffic on the westbound stretch of I-94 near the station located between Minneapolis and Saint Paul. By analyzing traffic volume data using Python and its data analysis libraries, we focused on understanding the influence of various factors, including time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.

Our findings reveal that traffic volumes are highest during the morning and evening rush hours on business days, with lower volumes during nighttime and weekends. Weather conditions, particularly "Light rain and snow" and "Shower snow," correlate with increased traffic but show only a weak overall impact. These results offer insights for improving traffic management specific to the westbound direction near this station and should not be generalized to the entire I-94 highway.
